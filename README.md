# Datacamp-Case-Study
This contains the capstone project I created for the Alteryx Fundamentals course on Datacamp.

This project involves the process of combining, cleaning, and transforming customer order data and order details to prepare it for further analysis and reporting. The workflow includes:

- **Data Integration**: Merged multiple customer order datasets, ensuring consistency and completeness across different data sources.
- **Data Cleaning**: Identified and removed duplicate records, handled missing values, and added supplementary data to enhance the dataset's accuracy and relevance.
- **Regional Insights**: Generated a regional counts file, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and distribution across different regions.
- **Data Transformation**: Restructured the data by calculating new fields, which were then integrated with existing customer data to create a more cohesive and comprehensive dataset.
- **Preparation for Analysis**: Optimized the data structure, making it ready for downstream analytics, visualization, or reporting purposes.

This project serves as a foundational step in ensuring that the customer order data is clean, well-structured, and ready for more advanced data analysis.
